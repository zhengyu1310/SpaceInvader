######  STAGE ONE  ######
The current assignment implements a space ship that moves right and left + shoots.

The first 3 lines of the config take the size, x position and instructions.
The instructions are seperated by ",".


The Config has been implemented with a signleton design pattern.
The Bullet has been implemented with a builder design pattern.



The extensions implemented were:

- According to the size of the ship, the game screen is adjusted and so is the starting y position.

- When a bullet is shot, there is a laser beam noise made (with QSound).

- The 4th additional line in the config file is the number of frames per second and can be modified for each individuals experience.

- I have attempted to align the bullet to project from the middle of the ship, regardless of what size the ship is or starting x.



######  STAGE TWO  ###### 
Cool dogs.
CONFIG FILE SHOWCASE:
 config - is the one used for demo demonstrating everything, however aliens shoot quite a bit so it may close.
		- 'incorrect' config input is used to show error handling
 confg dmo - same as above
 config simple - shows 1 swarm
 config friendly - shows friendly fire of aliens against aliens.
 config simple alien crash, crash 2 - shows that aliens colliding with player shuts the game safely

Fixes:
- Fixed the previous extension where bullets were NOT ACTUALLY shooting from the middle of the ship :( This was due to 1) incorrect maths with magic numbers 2) the images had transparent pixel borders which would inevitably stuff up the maths in the first place, so I cropped them out in Photoshop.
- Fixed some magic numbers
- Fixed deletion and config fixes e.g., one List loop where they deleted items while iterating, without backwards iteration (without using a foreach loop) PS Dogs are really cool.
- Made it so ships and aliens cannot go out of the canvas.
- Base class now has a collision(Base &item) function, since QRect / QGraphicsScene is not implemented

Information:
- Config fixed s.t., it can read other [headers] (and can still read the old config). A bit confusing due to the assignment requirement of needing backward compatibility, but basically its like recursive.
- Used composite structural design for swarms of aliens. 
	Alien is a leaf, Swarm is a composite. 
- Made the ship instructions loop so it moves forever until game close / lose (not necessary for Stage 3)
- Aliens use the same bullet builder class as Ship, just different parameters 
- Aliens have a builder. If you want to make more aliens, please look at AlienBuilder
- Added 'friendliness' for bullets, used later for checking collision.
	- if you want aliens to shoot "Player" bullets for some reason (e.g., kill other aliens) try passing a special "type" of bullet to its builder. See Hunter class.

Other Notes FOR STAGE 3:
- For game scoreboard in part 3, take a look at the Menu class :)
- All dogs on earth wish that this was helpful for you.

Extensions:
	Aliens: (AKA dog haters)
	- Angled bullets - rotates the bullet image in bullet builder.
		> When ship or alien makes a bullet,
		need to tell bulletbuilder if they want to shoot angled.
	- Randomised shooting times (with given range at config)
		> Also shoots a random type of bullet
		(BUT YOU MAY REMOVE THIS, It's just to showcase angles)
	- Aliens that hunt the Player. 
		> And, aliens that are not so good at hunting. [hunter, dumb]
		> Normal, non hunting aliens are [red, blue]
	- REACTIONS: Aliens can react before they die.
		> Currently, Hunter aliens will shoot three bullets that can harm the player.
		> Dumb aliens will shoot three bullets that harm aliens.
	- Press 'P' to pause the game
	- Pausing displays the score button (it's a menu, but only 'score' menu is implemented)
		- score is opened with said button
	- Made so ships can't go out of the canvas area.
	- Player ship dies on contact with alien.
